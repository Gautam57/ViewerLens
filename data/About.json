And 2 of these glorified initiatives are the ONDC and OCEN initiative!!!\nThese 2 initiatives have failed so badly that ONDC's app is worse than a college studentâ€™s first-year project and OCEN has been ignored by the biggest banking players of the country!!\nAnd the reason why we are making a video on this failure is because 2 years ago, we ourselves made a video on how revolutionary this initiative was!!! And one wise comment said, that I wish all the initiatives mentioned in this channel actually get executed but sadly they are just announcements with no action!! So we have decided that we will not just make a video when there is a sensational announcement but also follow up on the action so that we can help you differentiate between marketing and action!! So in this episode today,\nLetâ€™s try to understand,\nWhere are the biggest gaps in UPI?\nWhy are ONDC and OCEN slowing down?\nAnd what are the lessons that we need to learn from this slowdown of ONDC and OCEN!!\n\nAs few of you have asked for the CashBook app link in comment, here it is: \nhttps://cbook.page.link/think\n\n\n\nâœ…Study Materials:\n\nhttps://www.dataforindia.com/access-to-banking/#:~:text=There%20are%20now%20nearly%202.5,more%20bank%20accounts%20than%20women.\n\nhttps://www.financialexpress.com/business/sme-aditya-birla-finance-joins-ocen-for-loans-to-msmes-on-gem-sahay-3240040/\n\nhttps://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/gem-sahay-lenders-seeking-platforms-repayment-support/articleshow/114918082.cms#:~:text=This%20pilot%20project%20aims%20to,is%20as%20of%20January%202024.\n\nhttps://retail.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/e-commerce/e-tailing/gem-sahay-lenders-are-seeking-repayment-support-from-portal/114935405\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/021216/top-problems-financial-data-aggregation.asp#:~:text=Banks%20have%20typically%20been%20hesitant%20at%20sharing%20client%20data%20with%20third%2Dparty%20fintech%20firms%20and%20financial%20aggregators%20due%20to%20privacy%20concerns.\n\nhttps://yourstory.com/2025/02/phonepe-exits-account-aggregator-business-embracing-partnership-aa#:~:text=Given%20competing%20priorities%2C%20we%20have%20decided%20to%20exit%20the%20business%20and%20instead%20partner%20with%20other%20AAs%20in%20the%20market.\n\nhttps://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/gem-sahay-lenders-seeking-platforms-repayment-support/articleshow/114918082.cms?from=mdr#:~:text=GeM%20Sahay%201.0%20has%20been%20discontinued\n\n\nThink School is a Digital School that we all deserved, but never had\nâ–ºâ–ºCheck out Think School's Online courses: https://www.thethinkschool.com\n\n\n\n#thinkschool #businesscasestudy #geopolitics\n\nCredits: CNN-News 18, WION, NBC News, Money control pro, Business standard, TV18,Business Today, ABC news, CNBC, ET now ,Bloomberg originals, Financial Times, DW documentary, AL Jazeera English, BBC news, Firstpost.",
