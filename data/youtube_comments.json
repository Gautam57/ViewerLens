But target lenders should be NBFCs which are currently in partnership with Slice or KreditBee type apps which are bridging the very micro credit gap of 10s of thousands.\nBanks will show reluctance as they want Bank account to be opened before processing any loan but NBFCs which are currently lending through apps like Slice, KreditBee etc have no such restrictions while lending. Only credit account and KYC is needed that's it.\n\nUnlike UPI which is a transaction switch and there is a set of guidelines for transaction mechanism set by RBI.\nThere is no one such mechanism in place for marketplace like model because Marketplace is something which Government cannot control by placing a Standard Operating Procedure as such like a Bank 2 Bank transaction.\n\nBut yes OCEN can be made successful but ONDC is very difficult.",

People who cracks government exams and sits on the post that are meant to serve the nation...have become only job security and payments done by the government just to keep the system running...the problem is with the people themselves...they don't want to work they just wants the security that no one can ever get you out of once you are on it even if you don't do anything....

    "text": "Despite the massive success of UPI‚Äîlargely accelerated by the pandemic pushing India towards digital payments‚Äîit‚Äôs disheartening to see initiatives like ONDC and OCEN failing to strike a chord with the masses. These projects, while ambitious, seem to lack ground-level understanding of Indian consumer behavior. People here don't easily switch platforms once they are comfortable with a vendor. Case in point: Zepto‚Äôs rapid rise has significantly impacted Amazon Fresh, showing how quickly preferences can shift‚Äîbut only when there's real value.\n\nUnfortunately, ONDC and OCEN feel like experiments that have consumed time, money, and energy without practical outcomes. Aadhaar itself may not have gained traction if it wasn‚Äôt made mandatory‚Äîits success is more by enforcement than adoption. Nandan Nilekani‚Äôs vision for a digital India, inspired by systems like the SSN in the U.S., is admirable, but implementation without alignment to public sentiment risks becoming a missed opportunity. These initiatives need more than vision‚Äîthey need relevance, usability, and most importantly, public trust.",

    "text": "They first captured India‚Äôs data off entire loan market bye capturing share in Cibil Buy transunion. Then we search the internet banking website on Google and enter our credentials, so our entire details are with Google. Dave provided card network services so our card and account details are with American companies like Visa and MasterCard. UPI was symbol of our independence from dependency on American companies. But there also Google sneaked into UPI and our independent payment system again went in their hands. Now these ONDC also will go in hand of Microsoft‚Äôs. So whatever we purchase on e-commerce, will be through Microsoft‚Äôs platform.\nIt seems this is all deliberate move off American establishment and government as they don‚Äôt want our financial system/currency/payment settlement to go out of the orbit of their dominance and dependence. It‚Äôs very easy for them to bribe the concerned Indian officials/politicians for allowing them to participate in our systems, which can be easily run indigenously. It clearly appears that this is all due to strategic reason. India is very big country with large resources and population. If any time in future if India turns strategically adverse or rival country, they can hijack the entire financial and banking/payment system of India.\nJago Indians Jago when we will be free from digital colonisation. Or at least when we will strive to be independent from digital colonisation.",

The common man does not pay anything directly, its the vendors who would pay the fee(may be it is added to the cost), so does not matter if you use credit card or pay cash, everyone ends up contributing to it. The reason for UPI in India and the reason many developed countries not having it are very practical in their own ways. Just simple unreasonable comparison and boasting do not help.

Do you really think that countries like USA, UK, China, and other tech-rich countries would not have launched their version of UPI way before if they had been able to convince their banks for no transaction fees? You are looking at UPI as a consumer, but think if you are the owner of the bank and you provide your customer the service of online transaction by developing the tech, hiring employees, paying different charges, salaries, development and maintenance cost, charges of api calling per transaction, running the app and etc, and all of these expenses CAN BE covered by charging 1 or 2% of each transaction fees(like 1 or 2 rupees on 100rs payment) but your government tell you that you can not charge anything, and give it all for free. What would you have done?"

Very few media try to stay neutral. If you think that there is Godi media only on one side then you are so naive!! Lapdog media exists in both sides!! That is the reality worldwide. Google ‚Äò international media bias chart‚Äô to understand their biases! Any media on the extreme right or extreme right left in these charts are filled with one sided ideological narratives!"

        "text": "@Artrader_em8ko¬†I got the hint of you sarcasm but the point you raised is actually debatable. In my opinion, sudden change in his perspective has brought this change in reach too. Previously he was only appreciative about such steps from the govt. but now he is showing the actual hollow system behind all these projects, almost everything is just a hoax no thoughts and planning involved in it as if the government only attempted to distract everyone. Whereas the channels you mentioned were at anti-fascist BJP stance so whatever reach they had from the beginning is solid and recently their reach increased because many people started realising the truth and got fed up with godi media. The best example you'll see is for Abhi and Niyu channel. They got their reward for chaplusi and their fake persona got exposed. They had a hard hit in the beginning but still continued because they aren't running educational video contents their contents are only clear and blatant chaplusi so all the idiots from this country who think and believe that a humans can be born without any biological process or eating cow dung and drinking the piss off the cow can cure everything like it is some sort of panacea"
