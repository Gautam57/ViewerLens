You saved my life. You protected me from the Lord of Death. Our two destinies were written
as one. You and I are now bound together
as one. Till the very end. - If I jump 8ft, you'll jump 18.
- 16. OK! Maths whiz. I'll handle things from inside.
Amar will handle the rest. If Amar is the boss,
do I just watch? Something doesn't feel right.
Don't go now. Madam, I am your only Adam. Power is not for the asking. It is for the taking. From now, I'm Rangaraya Sakthivel. Death and I have been
playing this game. Who wins?
